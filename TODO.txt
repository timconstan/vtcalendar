FEATURES
--------
- don't allow calendar admins to lock themselves out from the calendar by restricting access
- search by sponsor
- display email addresses as javascript to protect against spammers
- harden against cross-site scripting attacks
- make "manage users" available in default calendar for all newly created calendars
  (important for setting passwords when LDAP is not used)
- document export parameters timebegin=today and rangedays=30
- document difference between a calendar and categories

BUGS
----
- when admin edits an "to-be-approved" item it is automatically approved (which is OK) but
also becomes the event of the admin (which is not OK)
- using the filter resets the calendar to the view that includes today
- userids are sometime case sensitive, sometimes not -> you may be able to login with an upper/lowercase Id but not "Manage users" for example


IDEAS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------
- iCal import
- sorted log
- have a print view for the calendar
- have a calendar output designed for pocket PC
- implement a year view that highlights certain admin or user-defined categories
- make it an option whether or not the admin gets an email upon a new event submission (the admin should be able to change that)
- remember search parameter after using the back button
- have a feature to allow copy of all search results via vCalendar/iCalendar
- improve search further (take out special characters [intelligently]) e.g. "parents' day"
